## Wiki Bias Research: Deletion Candidates Data Collection

This repository contains a Python script used for data collection in a research project investigating bias in Wikipedia's notability guidelines. The data collected comprises the names of academics whose Wikipedia articles were flagged for deletion.

## Description of the Code

The `WikiProjScrapingCode.ipynb` script is a web scraping tool that fetches information from a specific Wikipedia pageâ€”an archive of academics and educators whose articles were flagged for deletion. It extracts necessary details, including the name of the academic and the corresponding Wikipedia link, processes this data, and stores it in a .csv file named `wikicombo.csv`.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains:

- The `WikiProjScrapingCode.ipynb` Python script, the data collection tool.
- The `wikicombo.csv` file, the output of the script containing the list of academics and corresponding Wikipedia links.

These resources are integral to the data collection process of this research project.

## Disclaimer

The script is designed for research purposes, respecting ethical guidelines for web scraping. Please explore the code and data to understand our data collection process. Always consider the terms of service of websites and the potential impact of web scraping activities.
